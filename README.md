title:Analysis of the oneBlast eNewsletter experiment
---

# Setup
You should create a directory called 'data' in the working directory.

# Files

The source code is in R markdown format. To recreate our analysis (shown here in 
[HTML Version](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sbstusa/oneblast/blob/master/oneblast_analysis.html)
) you would either use the `Knit to HTML` button in RStudio or, after installing the rmarkdown package, do `library(rmarkdown);render("oneblast_analysis.Rmd")`.
